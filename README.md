A real-time language practice platform inspired by Duolingo's learning approach combined with Pramp's peer-to-peer interview format. Practice Spanish conversation with peers in structured, timed sessions! Peers alternate between being question askers and answerers in their targeted language, and askers can mark correct or incorrect for scoring. (Spanish Default for now).


## Inspiration
This project was inspired by me job hunting for a software engineering position and using Pramp/Exponent to practice for interviews. I also have been pretty competitive with friends in Duolingo recently. 

I visited Guatemala with my family, and in a coffee shop in Antigua, I saw tourists trying to practice micro interactions to order their coffee, and I got the idea to create a sort of pramp/duolingo hybrid where the pressure and accountability of a face to face video call is combined with the quick and segmented recitation formatting that Duolingo has.

Here is my rough mvp of what this could look like! I used webRTC and peerJS to create a peer-to-peer connection between two users, and React + Vite + MUI to get things going. 

## Todo list:

- [ ] Add time boxing to answer questions
- [ ] Add a scheduler to connect users at booked timeslots, like Pramp/Exponent
- [ ] Add a database to save session data, also to populate a question bank. (I just have some text Spanish questions for now)
- [ ] Friend feature to connect with friends and practice together (?)
- [ ] History feature to look back on previous sessions and scores
- [ ] Better flesh out peer to peer connections. (Currently running on a mock instance of a WebRTC peer connection for dev testing!)




### Real time connection stack:
- **WebRTC**: Peer-to-peer video and audio
- **WebSockets**: Signaling server for WebRTC connection establishment


## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

1. Create an immersive language learning experience
2. Facilitate peer-to-peer practice sessions
3. Provide structured conversation practice
4. Give immediate feedback on performance

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

The current build allows you to spawn in a mock peer WebRTC connection to simulate a peer in the call. The rolls of asking and answering questions alternates each round, but there is a role switching button for dev demo.
